# Domains_Top_URL_List_GoogleAPI
This project uses Google Search API to provide a list of most occurred urls based on domain keywords and phrases list. The code generates the phrases first based on the provided keywords and then use them for searching. After each searching, top 10 urls are considered and added to a dictionary. Iterating through all keywords, the dictionary is finally sorted based on the frequency of occurrence.
